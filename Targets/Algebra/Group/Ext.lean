# Extensionality lemmas for monoid and group structures

In this file we prove extensionality lemmas for `Monoid` and higher algebraic structures with one
binary operation. Extensionality lemmas for structures that are lower in the hierarchy can be found
in `Algebra.Group.Defs`.

## Implementation details

To get equality of `npow` etc, we define a monoid homomorphism between two monoid structures on the
same type, then apply lemmas like `MonoidHom.map_div`, `MonoidHom.map_pow` etc.

To refer to the `*` operator of a particular instance `i`, we use
`(letI := i; HMul.hMul : M → M → M)` instead of `i.mul` (which elaborates to `Mul.mul`), as the
former uses `HMul.hMul` which is the canonical spelling.
