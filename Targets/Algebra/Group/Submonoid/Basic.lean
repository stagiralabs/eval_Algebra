# Submonoids: `CompleteLattice` structure

This file defines a `CompleteLattice` structure on `Submonoid`s, define the closure of a set as the
minimal submonoid that includes this set, and prove a few results about extending properties from a
dense set (i.e. a set with `closure s = ⊤`) to the whole monoid, see `Submonoid.dense_induction` and
`MonoidHom.ofClosureEqTopLeft`/`MonoidHom.ofClosureEqTopRight`.

## Main definitions

For each of the following definitions in the `Submonoid` namespace, there is a corresponding
definition in the `AddSubmonoid` namespace.

* `Submonoid.copy` : copy of a submonoid with `carrier` replaced by a set that is equal but possibly
  not definitionally equal to the carrier of the original `Submonoid`.
* `Submonoid.closure` :  monoid closure of a set, i.e., the least submonoid that includes the set.
* `Submonoid.gi` : `closure : Set M → Submonoid M` and coercion `coe : Submonoid M → Set M`
  form a `GaloisInsertion`;
* `MonoidHom.eqLocus`: the submonoid of elements `x : M` such that `f x = g x`;
* `MonoidHom.ofClosureEqTopRight`:  if a map `f : M → N` between two monoids satisfies
  `f 1 = 1` and `f (x * y) = f x * f y` for `y` from some dense set `s`, then `f` is a monoid
  homomorphism. E.g., if `f : ℕ → M` satisfies `f 0 = 0` and `f (x + 1) = f x + f 1`, then `f` is
  an additive monoid homomorphism.

## Implementation notes

Submonoid inclusion is denoted `≤` rather than `⊆`, although `∈` is defined as
membership of a submonoid's underlying set.

Note that `Submonoid M` does not actually require `Monoid M`, instead requiring only the weaker
`MulOneClass M`.

This file is designed to have very few dependencies. In particular, it should not use natural
numbers. `Submonoid` is implemented by extending `Subsemigroup` requiring `one_mem'`.
