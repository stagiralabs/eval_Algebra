# Equal and mixed characteristic

In commutative algebra, some statements are simpler when working over a `ℚ`-algebra `R`, in which
case one also says that the ring has "equal characteristic zero". A ring that is not a
`ℚ`-algebra has either positive characteristic or there exists a prime ideal `I ⊂ R` such that
the quotient `R ⧸ I` has positive characteristic `p > 0`. In this case one speaks of
"mixed characteristic `(0, p)`", where `p` is only unique if `R` is local.

Examples of mixed characteristic rings are `ℤ` or the `p`-adic integers/numbers.

This file provides the main theorem `split_by_characteristic` that splits any proposition `P` into
the following three cases:

1) Positive characteristic: `CharP R p` (where `p ≠ 0`)
2) Equal characteristic zero: `Algebra ℚ R`
3) Mixed characteristic: `MixedCharZero R p` (where `p` is prime)

## Main definitions

- `MixedCharZero` : A ring has mixed characteristic `(0, p)` if it has characteristic zero
  and there exists an ideal such that the quotient `R ⧸ I` has characteristic `p`.

## Main results

- `split_equalCharZero_mixedCharZero` : Split a statement into equal/mixed characteristic zero.

This main theorem has the following three corollaries which include the positive
characteristic case for convenience:

- `split_by_characteristic` : Generally consider positive char `p ≠ 0`.
- `split_by_characteristic_domain` : In a domain we can assume that `p` is prime.
- `split_by_characteristic_localRing` : In a local ring we can assume that `p` is a prime power.

## Implementation Notes

We use the terms `EqualCharZero` and `AlgebraRat` despite not being such definitions in mathlib.
The former refers to the statement `∀ I : Ideal R, I ≠ ⊤ → CharZero (R ⧸ I)`, the latter
refers to the existence of an instance `[Algebra ℚ R]`. The two are shown to be
equivalent conditions.

## TODO

- Relate mixed characteristic in a local ring to p-adic numbers [NumberTheory.PAdics].

### Mixed characteristic
-/

/--
A ring of characteristic zero is of "mixed characteristic `(0, p)`" if there exists an ideal
such that the quotient `R ⧸ I` has characteristic `p`.

**Remark:** For `p = 0`, `MixedChar R 0` is a meaningless definition (i.e. satisfied by any ring)
as `R ⧸ ⊥ ≅ R` has by definition always characteristic zero.
One could require `(I ≠ ⊥)` in the definition, but then `MixedChar R 0` would mean something
like `ℤ`-algebra of extension degree `≥ 1` and would be completely independent from
whether something is a `ℚ`-algebra or not (e.g. `ℚ[X]` would satisfy it but `ℚ` wouldn't).

### Equal characteristic zero

A commutative ring `R` has "equal characteristic zero" if it satisfies one of the following
equivalent properties:

1) `R` is a `ℚ`-algebra.
2) The quotient `R ⧸ I` has characteristic zero for any proper ideal `I ⊂ R`.
3) `R` has characteristic zero and does not have mixed characteristic for any prime `p`.

We show `(1) ↔ (2) ↔ (3)`, and most of the following is concerned with constructing
an explicit algebra map `ℚ →+* R` (given by `x ↦ (x.num : R) /ₚ ↑x.pnatDen`)
for the direction `(1) ← (2)`.

Note: Property `(2)` is denoted as `EqualCharZero` in the statement names below.

# Splitting statements into different characteristic

Statements to split a proof by characteristic. There are 3 theorems here that are very
similar. They only differ in the assumptions we can make on the positive characteristic
case:
Generally we need to consider all `p ≠ 0`, but if `R` is a local ring, we can assume
that `p` is a prime power. And if `R` is a domain, we can even assume that `p` is prime.
